# LSTM_neuralnet
This is an LSTM (long short term memory) network built using just numpy. LSTM's are an improvement to recurrent networks, able to remember  long range dependencies.

## Overview   
We'll train an LSTM network built in pure numpy to generate Eminem lyrics. LSTMs are a fairly simple extension to neural networks, and they're behind a lot of the amazing achievements deep learning has made in the past few years.

## Dependencies

* numpy

Install dependencies using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)

## Usage

`python3 LSTM_Demo.py`
